# Calculator App

A minimal calculator built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports basic arithmetic operations in a clean responsive layout.

## Features

- Intuitive keypad layout with keyboard input support
- Real-time expression display and evaluation
- Clear (`C`) and delete (`⌫`) controls for quick corrections
- Responsive design suitable for mobile and desktop

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to try the calculator.
2. Review `script.js` for the input handling and evaluation logic.
3. Tweak colors, spacing, or typography in `styles.css` to match your brand.

## Project Structure

## Customization Tips

- Add advanced operations (percent, power, memory) by extending the button markup and event handlers.
- Introduce sound or vibration feedback when buttons are pressed for improved UX on mobile.
- Replace the evaluation logic with a safer parser if you plan to handle complex expressions.
